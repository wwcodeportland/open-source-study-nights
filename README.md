## :raised_hands: Help!
1. When you are stuck on code: Make an issue on what you‘re stuck on here - https://github.com/wwcodeportland/open-source-study-nights/issues
2. When you are lost, on your way and stuck in traffic and need to let someone know about something, left something at the venue, confused about parking, leave a comment on the https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland event invite for that night or message Keeley on Twitter [@keeleyhammmond](https://twitter.com/keeleyhammond).
3. When you have questions/concerns about code of conduct, things like that, talk to Keeley or Alex by messaging them on Meetup.com.
