### :zap: Where to start:

You're welcome to find an issue in this repo, and submit a Pull Request if you'd like to practice your git workflow, or just interacting with open source in a more low risk way.

There are also many major companies participating in Hacktoberfest, that have issues marked for first time contributors. You can find some of these below:

            <td>Docs, React, Node</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Docs, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### Refresh your git
One of the most challenging parts of contributing to open source is using git. Each project may have slightly different ways that they'd like a pull request submitted - for example, they may ask that you rebase your branch before merging, or base your branch against a specific existing branch. Make sure to read the project's contributing guidelines before starting your work.
